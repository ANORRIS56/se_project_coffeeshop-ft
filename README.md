# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the fulltime Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5

## Plan on improving the project

I plan on improving this project, by becoming more familiar with the coding process and learning how to use different features to achieve the same processes.
